            <h1>Ex-Video Producer becomes a developer - what gives?</h1>
            <p>(Honestly, the two industries aren't as far apart as you might think.)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since being introduced to coding as a child, I had always had an enthusiasm for creating. The rush I got from creating my first Python text game had 
                stayed with me and, as I grew up (and forgot about my childhood interests), led me to a 5-year career as a producer and student filmmaker. 
                I have since realised that my passion for development is irreplaceable.</p>

            <h1>It all started with Northcoders.</h1>
            <p>(And Annas.)</p>
            <p>2021 had been a difficult year for most of us, myself included. I had lost confidence in my industry, and my soul was craving 
                something different. A growing interest in development and Web 3.0 technology started to consume my spare-time. The stars aligned and, 
                with a little push from a close friend, I left my career and embarked on a journey into the world of coding - starting with a 
                13-week intensive <a href="https://northcoders.com/">Northcoders</a> course in software development.</p>
